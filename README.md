Facial Emotions Detection Using Machine Learning.
Implemented the real time recognition system that traces the very mood of the human. Facial Emotion 
reflects a personâ€™s personality, mind and it is shown by face. Built a Convolution Neural Network architecture 
and trained the model on a dataset for Emotion recognition from images.
